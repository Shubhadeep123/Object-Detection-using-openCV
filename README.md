This project demonstrates object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework with Python and OpenCV. 
It detects commonly used objects in real-time from video feeds or image files. YOLO is known for its speed and accuracy in detecting objects, making it ideal for various applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and object tracking.
